Recently I got access to a dataset about costal karnataka brahmins. Here are some interesting findings. 

There are mainly five types of brahmins that I've analyzed. 
- Kandavara Smartha
- Kota Smartha 
- Koteshwara Madhwa 
- Shivalli Smartha 
- Shivalli Madhwa 

#### **Kandavara Smartha** 
`N=22` These are brahmins who settled in Kandavara. (near Kundapura) They are followers of Adi Shankaracharya. 

Vishwamitra is the most common gotra among them:

Kuladevaru: 
- Bharadwaja - Anantheshwara, Udupi 
- Jamadagni - Kunjarugiri 
- Kashyapa - Ulluru Subramanya
- Viswamitra - Ulluru Subramanya 
- Haritasa - Anatheshwara & Ulluru

#### **Kota Smartha**
`N=234` These are brahmins who settled in Kota. (Saligrama) They are also followers of Adi Shankaracharya (i.e. Smartha)

Vishwamitra is the most common gotra here as well:

Koundinya `N=1`, Haritasa `N=2` are probably inaccuracies in the data and not gotras that are present in the community. 

All people from vishwamitra gotra have pravara as Madhushchanda / Dhananjaya. Devarata / Oudala pravara is not seen in Kota smartha brahmins.

Kuladevaru:
- Guru Narasimha, Saligrama for all gotras.

#### **Koteshwara Madhwa**
`N=107` These are brahmins who settled in Koteshwara. (Kundapura) They are followers of Madhwacharya. 

More than half of the population have gotra as Vishwamitra:

Kuladevaru: 
- Angirasa - Guru Narasimha, Saligrama 
- Vashishta - Guru Narasimha, Saligrama
- Vishwamitra - Mix of mainly Saligrama (60%) & Neelavara (23%)

#### **Shivalli Brahmins**
There are mainly two categories: 
- Shivalli Smartha 
- Shivalli Madhwa

Shivalli Madhwa comprise majority of the population:

Smartha are kannada speaking and Madhwa are Tulu speaking. There are a few `N=6` Shivalli Madhwa kannada speaking brahmins. These are most likely people who lost the ability to speak tulu.

#### **Shivalli Madhwa**
`N=925` These brahmins settled in a place called Shivalli near Udupi. They are followers of Madhwacharya.  

Unlike most other cases we have seen so far, Angirasa is the most common gotra!

Kuladevaru:

- Angirasa
  - Alevooru Vishnumoorthy (41%)
  - Kodangala Vishnumoorthy (15%) 

- Bhargava
  - Inna Muddannu, Mundkur (86%) 

- Vishwamitra 
  - Neelavara Mahishamardhini (45%) 
  - Ulluru Subramanya (39%)

Vishwamitra Gotra has mainly 2 pravaras. Devarata/Audala for whom the Kuladevaru is Mahishamardhini, Neelavara and Dhananjaya/Madhuschanda for whom the Kuladevaru is Ulluru Subramanya. 

#### **Shivalli Smartha**
`N=230` These brahmins continued to remain followers of Adi Shankaracharya ever after Madhwacharya rose to prominence in the area.

There is no major bias seen in the gotra wise distribution:
